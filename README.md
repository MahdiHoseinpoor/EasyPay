# EasyPay - Payment System
EasyPay is a modern payment processing platform designed for secure financial transactions. The system provides core banking features including account management, online payments, and transaction processing with robust authentication mechanisms.

Built on Clean Architecture principles, the project organizes code into distinct layers - Domain for business logic, Application for use cases, Infrastructure for technical implementations, and Presentation for API delivery. We implement CQRS pattern to separate read and write operations, enhancing performance and scalability.

The technical stack leverages ASP.NET Core for the backend framework, Entity Framework Core for data access, and SQL Server for database storage. 

This temporary documentation will be replaced with comprehensive guides covering API references, deployment procedures, and system diagrams once development reaches completion.
